# Base Image for Ubuntu Virtual Desktop images.  
# vdestop_ubuntu_base

This is the base image that I use for building vdesktop_UBUNTU virtual desktop docker contaienrs from.  

Theres nothing much to see here, it's basically just Ubuntu with the Gnome2 desktop environment installed, and a couple other tools that are mainstream enough to be pre-installed in all thr downstream image variants that are based on this image.
